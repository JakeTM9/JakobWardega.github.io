Hey this is just a practice website I made using a youtube tutorial. Super cool you can publish websites through github.
UPDATE 3/2/2019:  I followed a youtube guide to initially get this up. I made a bunch of changes that are all in a private repository. The link to the website in this repo is to my updated project - not the template you see here that I wrote with the help of a youtube video.
